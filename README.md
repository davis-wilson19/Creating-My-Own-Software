This is my first project and if it goes well, will help me land a job or create a bigger future for me. 
I have no experience at this time reguarding softwares. I know basic networking but that is about it.
Some may see this as too big of a project however, I see it as a great way to learn and develop my skills in relation to real issues.

In this software (subject to change) I will include:

  - Firewall/Network Filtering
      - This will control inbound/outbound traffic at host levels.
      - It will track connections and packets, filter different applications, and log packets to analyze.
  - Password Manager/Vault
      - This will hold passwords in secure locations and encrypt them to the outside and but allow autofill with some secure browser extensions.
  - Antivirus
      - Pattern-based scanning
  - Intrusion Detection/Prevention
      - Detects behavior on the endpoints
  - VPN/Secure Networking
      - Built-in to protect location
  - Disk Encryption/File Protection
      - Secure files by encrypting and decrypting
  - Impliment Auto-Updater
      - To not let attackers use phishing attempts through update links or applications 
  - Centralized Logging/Monitoring
      - Store logs locally or secure cloud sync
  - Web Security Features
      - Content filtering, secure DNS
